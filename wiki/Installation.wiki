#summary Guidelines for installation

= Introduction =
Currently the only way to use OpenEBSD is to compile from source. Instructions for obtaining the source from CVS are given under the 'Source Tab'.

= Required Packages =

== Compiler ==
*Windows:* The project has been sucessfully compiled under Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition, which is availible as a free download from http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/

*Unix:* The project requires GCC 4.2 or higher, which should be included with your distribution. On MacOS X you will need to install the free Developer Tools availible from Apple.

=== CMake ===
Build files for the project are generated by CMake. Visual C++ projects can be generated for Windows systems, make files can be generated for Unix systems. Builiding VTK also requires CMake. Availible from http://www.cmake.org/

=== Python ===
Python is not required to build the C++ libraries, but if Python is installed Python wrappers are build to expose allow the project to be scripted from Python. The is also a 'proof of concept' GUI which requires Python. Python 2.5 and SciPy are required.
Packaged installers are availible for Windows and Unix from http://code.enthought.com/downloads/.

=== Enthought Tool Suite ===
The Enthought tool suite is required for the GUI, this comes with the Python packages linked above. 

=== VTK ===
The Visualisation Toolkit is used for visualisation. Since we need the header files to link from C++, it must be compiled from source. The source and instructions for compiling are availible at http://www.vtk.org/. When compiling the _Build Shared Libraries_ and _Compile Python Wrappers_ options should be selected to ensure that the python interfaces are built. 

A slight quirk with the current release of VTK (5.0.4) under Windows requires that TCL/TK is installed and selected when the Python Wrappers are build, even though it isn't actaully required for this project. TCL/TK is availible from http://www.activestate.com/Products/activetcl/, version 8.4.x (instead of 8.5.x) is required.
