#summary Guidelines for Windows Installation

= Install Required Packages =

== Compiler ==
Microsoft Visual C++ Express can be used to compile OpenEBSD. It is available as a free download from http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/

== SVN Client ==
A SVN client is required to download the source. TortoiseSVN is a good free client for windows, available from http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads 

== CMake ==
Build files for the project are generated by CMake, builiding VTK also requires CMake. A Windows installer is available at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

== VTK ==
The Visualisation Toolkit is used for visualisation. Since we need the header files to link from C++, it must be compiled from source. The source and instructions for compiling are availible at http://www.vtk.org/. When compiling the _Build Shared Libraries_  options should be selected to ensure that the python interfaces are built. 

== wxWidgets ==
wxWidgets is required for the user interface. A windows installer is available from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/ (choose wxMSW). After installation you must build wxWidgets:

  # Navigate to C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw (or wherever you installed wxWidgets). Open wx.dsw which will open Visual C++. 
  # Under Build>Configuration Manager, select 'Debug'. 
  # Select Build>Build Solution.
  # Under Build>Configuration Manager, select 'Release'. 
  # Select Build>Build Solution.

Do not build any other of the configurations, as they can interfere with one another. 

= Checkout OpenEBSD source =
Follow these instructions to use TortoiseSVN obtain a copy of the source code from the SVN repository. 

  # Create two new folders OpenEBSDCode and OpenEBSDBuild in a folder of your choice, say C:\Development
  # Right-click on OpenEBSDCode and select 'SVN Checkout...'
  #
